### Hi there, my name is Damon. ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a full-stack software engineer student at General Assembly. I have a passion in coding and would love to collaborate on any projects. Here is a list of my skills:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- NodeJS, Express
- MongoDB
- React

I love writing server-side code, so I have a preference in the backend. I keep in mind to write code that is easy-to-read, organized, and fully functional.
